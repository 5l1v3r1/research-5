            <para>SSL/TLS is a deceptively simple technology. It is easy to deploy, and it just
                works&#x2026; except that it does not, really. The first part is true—SSL is easy to
                deploy—but it turns out that it is not easy to deploy
                <emphasis>correctly</emphasis>. To ensure that SSL provides the necessary security,
                users must put extra effort into properly configuring their servers.</para>
            <para>In 2009, we began our work on <link xlink:href="https://www.ssllabs.com/">SSL
                    Labs</link> because we wanted to understand how SSL was used and to remedy the
                lack of easy-to-use SSL tools and documentation. We have achieved some of our goals
                through our global surveys of SSL usage, as well as the online assessment tool, but
                the lack of documentation is still evident. This document is a first step toward
                addressing that problem.</para>
            <para>Our aim here is to provide clear and concise instructions to help overworked
                administrators and programmers spend the minimum time possible to deploy a secure
                site or web application. In pursuit of clarity, we sacrifice completeness, foregoing
                certain advanced topics. The focus is on advice that is practical and easy to
                understand. For those who want more information, Section 6 gives useful
                pointers.</para>

        <title>1. Private Key and Certificate</title>
        <para>The quality of the protection provided by SSL depends entirely on the private key,
            which lays down the foundation for the security, and the certificate, which communicates
            the identity of the server to its visitors.</para>
        <section renderas="sect3">
            <title>1.1. Use 2048-bit Private Keys</title>
            <para>Use 2048-bit RSA or equivalent-strength ECDSA private keys for all your servers.
                Keys of this strength are secure and should stay secure for a considerable amount of
                time. If you already have 1024-bit RSA keys in production, replace them with
                stronger keys as soon as possible. If you believe that you need more than 2048 bits
                of security, give more consideration to ECDSA keys, which have better performance
                characteristics.</para>

        <section renderas="sect3">
            <title>1.2. Protect Private Keys</title>
            <para>Treat your private keys as an important asset, restricting access to the smallest
                possible group of employees while still keeping the arrangements practical.
                Recommended policies include the following:</para>

                    <para>Password-protect keys to prevent compromise when they are stored in backup
                        systems.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>After compromise, revoke old certificates and generate new keys to use
                        with new certificates.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>Renew certificates every year and always with new private keys.</para>

            </itemizedlist>
        </section>
        <section renderas="sect3">
            <title>1.3. Ensure Sufficient Hostname Coverage</title>
            <para>Ensure that your certificates cover all the names you wish to use with a site. For
                example, your main name is <emphasis>www.example.com</emphasis>, but you may also
                have <emphasis>www.example.net</emphasis> configured. Your goal is to avoid invalid
                certificate warnings, which will confuse your users and weaken their trust.</para>
            <para>Even when there is only one name configured on your servers, remember that you
                cannot control how your users arrive at the site or how others link to the site. In
                most cases, you should ensure that the certificate works with and without the
                    <emphasis>www</emphasis> prefix (e.g., for both <emphasis>example.com</emphasis>
                and <emphasis>www.example.com</emphasis>). The rule of thumb is this: a secure web
                server should have a certificate that is valid for every DNS name configured to
                point to it.</para>
            <para>Wildcard certificates have their uses, but should be avoided if using them means
                exposing the underlying keys to a larger group of people, and especially if crossing
                organizational boundaries. In other words, the fewer people who have access to the
                private keys, the better.</para>
        </section>
        <section renderas="sect3">
            <title>1.4. Obtain Certificates from a Reliable CA</title>
            <para>Select a <firstterm>Certificate Authority</firstterm> (CA) that is reliable and
                serious about its certificate business and about security. Consider the following
                criteria when selecting your CA:</para>
            <variablelist>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term>Security posture</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>All CAs undergo regular audits (otherwise they wouldn't be able to
                            operate as CAs), but some are more serious about security than others.
                            Figuring out which ones are better in this respect is not easy, but one
                            option is to examine their security history, and, more important, how
                            they reacted to compromises and if they learned from their
                            mistakes.</para>

                        <para>A CA that meets this criterion will not likely have all its
                            certificates easily recalled, which was the case with some smaller ones
                            in the past.</para>

                            probably won&#x2019;t neglect their certificate division by chasing
                            potentially more lucrative opportunities elsewhere.</para>

                        <para>At minimum, your selected CA should provide support for both

                            (OCSP) revocation and provide an OCSP service with good performance.
                            They should offer both domain-validated and Extended Validation
                            certificates, ideally with your choice of public key algorithm. (Most
                            web sites use RSA today, but ECDSA may become important in the future
                            because of its performance advantages.)</para>

        <title>2. Configuration</title>
        <para>With correct SSL server configuration, you ensure that your credentials are properly
            presented to the site’s visitors, that only secure cryptographic primitives are used,
            and that all known weaknesses are mitigated.</para>
        <section renderas="sect3">
            <title>2.1. Deploy with Complete and Valid Certificate Chains</title>
            <para>In most deployments, the server certificate alone is insufficient; two or more
                certificates are needed to establish a complete chain of trust. A common problem is
                configuring the server certificate correctly but forgetting to include other
                required certificates. Further, although these other certificates are typically
                valid for longer periods of time, they too expire, and when they do, they invalidate
                the entire chain. Your CA should be able to provide you with all the additional
                certificates required.</para>
            <para>An invalid certificate chain renders the actual server certificate invalid and
                results in browser warnings. In practice, this problem is sometimes difficult to
                diagnose because some browsers can deal with these problems and reconstruct a
                complete correct chain, and some can’t.</para>

        <section renderas="sect3">
            <title>2.2. Use Only Secure Protocols</title>
            <para>There are five protocols in the SSL/TLS family: SSL v2, SSL v3, TLS v1.0, TLS
                v1.1, and TLS v1.2. Of these:</para>
            <para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>SSL v2 is insecure and must not be used.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>SSL v3 is very old and obsolete. Because it lacks some key features
                            and because virtually all clients support TLS 1.0 and better, you should
                            not support SSL v3 unless you have a <emphasis>very</emphasis> good
                            reason.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>TLS v1.0 is largely still secure; we do not know of major security
                            flaws when they are used for protocols other than HTTP. When used with
                            HTTP, it can <emphasis>almost</emphasis> be made secure with careful
                            configuration.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>TLS v1.1 and v1.2 are without known security issues.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            <para>TLS v1.2 should be your main protocol. This version is superior because it offers
                important features that are unavailable in earlier protocol versions. If your server
                platform (or any intermediary device) does not support TLS v1.2, make plans to
                upgrade at an accelerated pace. If your service providers do not support TLS v1.2,
                require that they upgrade.</para>
            <para>In order to support older clients, you need to continue to support TLS v1.0 and
                TLS v1.1 for the time being. With some workarounds (explained in subsequent
                sections), these protocols can still be considered secure enough for most web
                sites.</para>

            <title>2.3. Use Only Secure Cipher Suites</title>
            <para>To communicate securely, you must first ascertain that you are communicating
                directly with the desired party (and not through someone else who will eavesdrop),
                as well as exchanging data securely. In SSL and TLS, cipher sites are used to define
                how secure communication takes place. They are composed from varying building blocks
                with the idea of achieving security through diversity. If one of the building blocks
                is found to be weak or insecure, you should be able to switch to another.</para>
            <para>Your goal should be thus to use only suites that provide authentication and
                encryption of 128 bits or stronger. Everything else must be avoided:</para>

            <para>In SSL v3 and later versions, clients submit a list of cipher suites that they

            <para>In SSL/TLS, renegotiation allows parties to stop exchanging data in order to
                renegotiate how the communication is secured. There are some cases in which
                renegotiation needs to be initiated by the server, but there is no known need for
                clients to do so. Further, client-initiated renegotiation may make your servers

                            Unfortunately, to mitigate server-side requires RC4, which we now

                single unprotected JavaScript resource, for example, and hijack the entire user
                session. Even if you follow the advice from the previous section and encrypt your

                third-party web sites.</para>

            <title>4.3. Understand and Acknowledge Third-Party Trust</title>
            <para>Web sites often use third-party services activated via JavaScript code downloaded
                from another server. A good example of such a service is Google Analytics, which is
                used on large parts of the Web. Such inclusion of third-party code creates an
                implicit trust connection that effectively gives the other party full control over
                your web site. The third party may not be malicious, but large providers of such
                services are increasingly seen as targets. The reasoning is simple: if a large
                provider is compromised, the attacker is automatically given access to all the sites
                that depend on the service.</para>
            <para>If you follow the advice from Section 4.2, at least your third-party links will be
                encrypted and thus safe from MITM attacks. However, you should go a step further

            <para><emphasis>HTTP Strict Transport Security</emphasis> (HSTS) is a safety net for
                SSL: it was designed to ensure that security remains intact even in the case of
                configuration problems and implementation errors. To activate HSTS protection, you
                set a single response header in your web sites. After that, browsers that support
                HSTS (at this time, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera) will enforce it.</para>
            <para>The goal of HSTS is simple: after activation, it does not allow any insecure
                communication with the web site that uses it. It achieves this goal by automatically
                converting all plain-text links to secure ones. As a bonus, it also disables
                click-through SSL certificate warnings. (SSL certificate warnings are an indicator
                of an active MITM attack. Studies have shown that most users click through these
                warnings, so it is in your best interest to never allow them.)</para>
            <para>Adding support for HSTS is the single most important improvement you can make for

                        organization and its online identity. EV certificates are more difficult to
                        forge, provide slightly better security, and are better treated when
                        browsers present them to end users.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis>Public key pinning</emphasis> is designed to give web site
                        operators the means to restrict which Certificate Authorities can issue
                        certificates for their web sites. This feature has been deployed by Google
                        for some time now (it's hard-coded into their browser, Chrome) and has
                        proven to be very useful in preventing attacks and making the public aware
                        of them. Two proposals are currently being developed: <emphasis><link

                <listitem>
                    <para>Virtually all web sites rely on RSA private keys. This algorithm is thus
                        the key to the security of the Web, which is why attacks against it continue
                        to improve. We are currently transitioning from 1024-bit to 2048-bit RSA
                        keys for that very reason. There are some concerns, however, that further
                        key length increases might lead to performance issues. Elliptic Curve
                        cryptography uses different math and provides strong security assurances at
                        smaller key lengths. RSA keys can be replaced with ECDSA. They are currently
                        supported by only a small number of CAs, but we expect that most will offer
                        them in the future.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis>OCSP Stapling</emphasis> is a modification of the OCSP protocol
                        that allows revocation information to be bundled with the certificate itself
                        and thus served directly from the server to the browser. As a result, the
                        browser does not need to contact OCSP servers for out-of-band validation,
                        which results in better performance.</para>
